**üìù Description**

This project involved analyzing and visualizing the operational and financial performance of a **toy manufacturing startup**, MA Toy Factory, from **2012 to 2015**. The analysis aimed to support an investor pitch by showcasing key performance metrics, growth trends, and operational efficiencies using a combination of SQL queries for data extraction and Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) for visualization and deeper insights.

**üìä Project Objectives**

This project focuses on 4 Major KPIs:

**KPI 1: Total Sessions and Volumns.**
**KPI 2: Revenue per order (Rate Analysis).**
**KPI 3: Growth-Rate Analysis.**
**KPI 4: Product & Order Funnel Analysis.**

## My Approch: 
    1. Data Cleaning and EDA
    2. Analysis for Each KPIs using Seaborn and matplotlib library. 
    3. Finding the breakthroughs and improvements of each year's quarterly performance.  
**KPI 1: Total Sessions and Volumns.**

The total sessions and  volumns we got throughout each year covering from March 3rd 2012 to March 3rd 2015:

* Improvements increased by 50% by the year 2014 based on the overall sessions on the website. 
* A positive start with sessions can be seen from the year 2015.

* Above you can see the route of overall sessions which is being divided quarterly from 2012 to 2015. 
*breakthrough: From the year January 2014 we got incredible increment which was constant till June. 
*Although we suffered a sudden attenuation in between which was suprisingly regained by the end of the year. (Reason could be great deals of black friday, boxing day and christmas).

**KPI 2: Revenue per order (Rate Analysis).**

The above box plot shows the insights of our companies quarter-wise revenue per order analysis (Covers 2012-2015)
* **Q1** suggests the revenue is fairly consitent and gives new oppertunity to desing post-holiday customer demands, discounts etc. 
* **Q2 & Q3** shows the less revenue generated through out the months covered in between. (The reason for showing this could be a result of matching average number of customer's shopping pattern around the market. This alaysis could be same with atleast 60% of the job market.)
* **Q4** The increased variability in Q4 suggests opportunities for optimizing marketing campaigns or inventory during the holiday season to capitalize on higher-value orders.

**KPI 3: Growth-Rate Analysis (Bsearch vs Bsearch)**

Insights from the Line Chart:

Growth Trend:
Both Gsearch_nonbrand and Bsearch_nonbrand show a positive growth trajectory over time, indicating successful performance improvements in these marketing channels.

Gsearch Dominance:

* The Gsearch_nonbrand consistently outperforms Bsearch_nonbrand in volume throughout the analysis period, demonstrating its higher effectiveness and reach.
* By the end of the observation period, Gsearch achieves over 3000 conversions, significantly surpassing Bsearch.

Bsearch Volatility:

* Bsearch_nonbrand exhibits higher volatility, with sharper rises and falls compared to the steady growth of Gsearch.
* This indicates that Bsearch might be more sensitive to campaign changes or external market conditions.
Peak Performance:

Both channels experience a steep rise in performance during 2014-2015, showcasing the impact of targeted optimization efforts or increased ad spend.
A slight decline is observed for both channels in the last quarter, which could highlight seasonality or reduced campaign efficiency.

**Our approch**: We invested more into Gsearch_nonbrand campaings after expecting a loads of session and bidding-down for Bsearch_nonbrand campaigns. 

**KPI 4: Product & Order Funnel Analysis.**

Growth Over Time:

* Metrics like sessions_to_product_page and orders clearly increase over the years.
This suggests that website traffic and order conversions are improving steadily from 2012 to 2015.
Strong Relationships:

* Sessions_to_product_page and orders have a clear, positive correlation. More sessions on the product page directly drive more orders.

* clickthrough_rt shows a stable distribution over the years, suggesting consistent engagement at this stage of the funnel.

There are lot of insights I've discussed in the jupyter notebook itself. Please go through it and provide you recommendations.
